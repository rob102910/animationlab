<h1>This Website is about effective visualization</h1>
<h3>Prompt:Provide a website to answer the following questions about the Cairo reading. If you are aiming to do something extra, support your arguments with specific charts of you own making (use excel or some other tool, don't program them)</h2>
<h3>Why is visualization effective?</h3>
  <p>Visualization is effective as it helps people to get a grasp of what data means. This is seen in how students were happy 
    with a grade of 96 out of 137 and yet not happy with a 72 out of 100 which was actually a better score. How data is presented
    may have a large effect in how someone sees it. Another reason 
    visualization is so effective is because vision is the most developed sense which humans have. As people have evolved 
    to detect visual patterns, visualization is very effective in communicating information. </p>
<h3>What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks?</h3>
  <p>The most effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks is to map data into visual properties. This means 
    choosing graphing methods which present the data towards a certain goal and makes  it easy to understand. 
    In general, data should...  <p/>
    <p>be plotted directly.  </p> 
  <p>If the differences matter more, then the differences should be plotted.  </p> 
  <p>Use logical and meaningful baselines  </p> 
  <p>If data varies too much that presenting them all on a single chart renders it useless, plot your data in several 
    charts with dissimilar scales</p>
  
<h3>What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization</h3>
  <p>The trade off which Cairo mentions the most is the trade off between a graph that looks 
    aesthetically pleasing, and one which is more informative and clear. He also makes notes about the trade off
  between showing information more clearly, or highlighting one aspect as the focus and losing accuracy</p>
